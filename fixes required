okay, we solved a lot of errors. the app actually works for the first time.
However, I am going to jot down some of the errors that i see that we will need to solve together. 
Help me summarize my ask for AI to help me fix, improve the functionality of the app further.
Do not jump into coding at the moment

Dashboard
- top ribbon, i need the sum of the total holding shown as well.
- provide ability to edit current prices right in the dashboard if the API integration is disabled in the settings tab
- total qty of shares and avg cost needs to be updated based on the activity tab trades, which is not updating at the moment


Activity tab
- when i add additional contract for the same strike price and expiry for the same ticker, they are not combining
for example, I have 3 TSLA $450 strike expiry 10-04-2025 at $5 premium per contract, I add 1 TSLA $450 strike expiry 10-04-2025 at $10 premium per contract at later date. They should combine to show 4 TSLA $450 strike expiry 10-04-2025 now cost average $6.25 premium per contract as one tile
- when I sell call, it should locked 100 shares of the underlying asset
for example, I have 213 shares of TSLA, I sell 1 TSLA call at strike $500 expiry 10-04-2026 at premium gain of $105 per contract. I now have 100 TSLA shares which i can not sell. Max i can now sell is 113 shares out of the 213 shares of TSLA until the Sold call expires or I buy it back at higher or lower premium (which will determine my P&L) Locked shared should be shown for that particular asset in the dashboard (in quick stats)
- In order to close a sell call position, I will move the tile from Sell postions to Buy positions side, at this moment, i need a pop up window which asks for two things if the option expired (yes or no), premium paid to close the contract (this can be higher or lower which helps calculate P&L)
for example, I sold 1 TSLA call at $450 strike, expiring 10-04-2025 for the premium gain of $20 per contract. In order to close this position, I will move this tile to Buy, the pop window asked me if the option expired (yes or no), if I select "yes" i do not need to enter anything else at this point, I keep the original premium that i gained which is $20 per contract, realizing $2000 profit. 
In different scenario, If i close this position before the expiry date, I would most likely select "no" for option expired , which will allow my enter the premium paid per contract, in this case I am paying $10 per contract to close this position. Original premium gain $20 - $10 (buy to close) = $10 per contract which equated to $1000 gain in realized profit.

- when i move the tile to close a position, it should also active a little X icon in the top right corner, when pressing the icon, it will remove the tile from the view

- I should be able to sell all the contracts or stocks that were combined in the single tile or broken apart, either way

- tile spliting should have option to choose qty or ability to pick qty from the share lots 
for example, I bought TSLA shares at three different times and in different qty,
